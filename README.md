# Project
 The development team (Spotlight Consulting) will work to develop an efficient and effective data extraction process of band-based generator price and supply offer data supplied by the AEMO. The data extraction software will have intended use by Griffith University’s CAEEPR (Centre for Applied Energy Economics and Policy Research) to better understand the wholesale market operations of the NEM (National Electricity Market).  

The data extraction process should aim to be a set of code that can read in the .csv files supplied by the AEMO, retrieving data relevant to CAEEPR. CAEEPR are most interested in having the ability to search for band-based supply-offer bids of one or more generators at a time. The software should be capable of then writing this filtered data to a new excel file.  

The client’s aims are to minimise ‘hands on’ activity meaning the software should be intuitive and not require at length training to utilise the program.
